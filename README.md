# sublime-react

Snippets and syntax highlighting for React.js / JSX.

This is a ES6-compatible version of [sublime-react](https://github.com/reactjs/sublime-react), without the coffeescript thing. I'm using it in my own Sublime Text environment, in pair with [6to5](https://6to5.org/). 

To use this version, add this repository to your Package Manager and install again sublime-text.
